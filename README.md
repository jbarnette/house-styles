# House Styles

A repository of code style guides, written in Markdown. Fork it, add
your own, and send a pull request! Copy the structure of an existing
style guide if you like it, but feel free to improve as well.

## Meta

Write your guide in Markdown, wrap at 80 columns. Don't forget to add
it to the **Styles** section below (and please keep it alphabetized).
The guide itself should go in `styles/org-lang/README.md`, e.g.,
`styles/audiosocket-ruby/README.md`.

Examples are awesome. Inline examples in your guide are good, but also
consider including some full example files next to your guide's
`README.md`. Name the primary example file `example.language`, e.g.,
`styles/audiosocket-ruby/example.rb`.
